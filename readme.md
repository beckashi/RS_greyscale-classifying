#greyscale classifying to work


areas of greyscale must be seperated by a distance or limited to some size - what are the limits here? Therefore, you could hypothesise when the greyscale classifying will begin to break, and then make an experiment to measure if this is true.  This is just an example, and it will depend on what you actually implement.  A good way to think about this step of analysis/evaluation, is that if you were designing a product or buying a product, you will need to also know the limits of the performance of the system to make a good decision.  E.g, if I was to buy your greyscale classifying solution, I would want to know how many greyscale classifications can read, but also the limits, when it will go wrong, etc, so I can decide if it will suit my application.   So aim to make this kind of analysis and evaluation the end goal of your work. 

Make a plan:
Week1: discuss about greyscale classifying to work
Make a clear design about the challenges and make the actual hypothesis of our investigation.
