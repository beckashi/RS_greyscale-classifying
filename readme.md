# greyscale classifying #

Our 3Pi+ is expected to use infrared sensors for the purpose of greyscale classifying varying surfaces.

Firstly, we need to collect the return value of infrared sensors on a certain distance of different greyscale surfaces and in the same environment.
When performing the task, we would have the robot move across the surface and connect the robot to the computer, allowing the sensing intensity of the reflection collected by the sensors to be returned to the computer.
This data will help us to identify the specific greyscale of surface that robots are moving on at different times.

Areas of greyscale must be seperated by a distance or limited to some size - what are the limits here? Therefore, you could hypothesise when the greyscale classifying will begin to break, and then make an experiment to measure if this is true.  This is just an example, and it will depend on what you actually implement.  A good way to think about this step of analysis/evaluation, is that if you were designing a product or buying a product, you will need to also know the limits of the performance of the system to make a good decision.  E.g, if I was to buy your greyscale classifying solution, I would want to know how many greyscale classifications can read, but also the limits, when it will go wrong, etc, so I can decide if it will suit my application.   So aim to make this kind of analysis and evaluation the end goal of your work. 

## plan:  ##
Week1: discuss about greyscale classifying to work. 

Then, make a clear design about the challenges and make the actual hypothesis of our investigation.

(11.9 before the meeting with supervisor)


From Dr. Paul:

Week 1: write code, take measurements, plot graphs, take to meeting

Week 2: decide what technique to apply to filter out noise, or combine sensors to improve measurement accuracy/precision, implement, test, plot results

Week 3: decide what else is interesting

Week 4: Focus on report

Week 5: finish writing report.
(12.4: finish the whole report)
